# ImageTypes

This repository is home to some code I use for reading, writing, or interoperating with various images.

It uses CMake, so you should be able to work with it pretty easily in most IDE's.  The tldr for using cmake is

`mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../ && cmake --build .`




## Red

A small demo of using the R3DSDK with CMake

You'll need to install the SDK separately, but it's fairly easy to get ahold of these days.

# License

This repo has a "BSD Two-Clause" license.  I think that means you can pretty do whatever you want with the code I've written here.  It just doesn't apply to anything I didn't write.
